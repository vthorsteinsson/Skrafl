## Skraflhjálp (SCRABBLE(tm) Helper)

### English summary

This set of Python 3.x programs and modules
implements a dictionary and word permutation engine that is the core of an
[Icelandic SCRABBLE(tm) Helper website](https://skraflhjalp.appspot.com).

The web and its engine are helpful for SCRABBLE(tm) players, crossword
enthusiasts and others - including programmers - who are interested in fast and
flexible dictionary implementation, for Icelandic and other languages.

The software uses a [*DAWG*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_acyclic_finite_state_automaton)
(*Directed Acyclic Word Graph*, also called *Deterministic Acyclic Finite State Automaton*, *DAFSA* or
*Minimal Acyclic Finite State Automaton*, *MA-FSA*) to represent the dictionary.
This enables very fast lookup, pattern matching and permutation, even with wildcards
and long letter sequences.

The DAWG is pre-built from plain text word lists, compacted on-the-fly
and stored in a compact - yet Pythonistic - text-based form.

The algorithm for building an optimal DAWG from lists of valid words is based on the theory
of [Daciuk et al](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J00-1002.pdf), with reference
to [Steve Hanov's implementation](https://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=115)
(and a nod to [ftbe's Go code on GitHub](https://github.com/ftbe/dawg)).
However it optimizes further than Hanov does by collapsing chains of nodes connected by single
edges into multi-letter edges, reducing the node count significantly.

At run time, permutations are found in an efficient way, even in the presence of
wildcards (blank tiles), by direct traversal of the graph.
For details see the ```dawgbuilder.py``` and ```dawgdictionary.py``` files.

The code builds a 103,000 node DAWG for the Icelandic language, 2.6 million words, in about
38 seconds (PyPy) / 160 seconds (CPython) on a medium-powered Windows desktop PC.
The resulting graph structure is stored in a 3,466 KB file and takes under 4 seconds to load
into memory.

For English, it converts the 178,691 words of the SCRABBLE(tm) Tournament World List v6 (TWL06)
into a graph of 29,691 nodes in under 3 seconds (PyPy) / 10 seconds (CPython). The resulting
.dawg.text file is 772 KB.

Generation of all permutations of a 7-letter SCRABBLE(tm) rack, as well as combinations of the
rack with one additional letter, typically takes 30-70 milliseconds (CPython).
