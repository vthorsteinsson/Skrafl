    SCRABBLE(tm) rack permutations

    Copyright (C) 2022 Miðeind ehf.
    Original author: Vilhjálmur Þorsteinsson

    This module implements a main class named Tabulator and
    a helper class named WordDatabase.

    Tabulator takes a SCRABBLE(tm) rack and processes it to find
    all valid word permutations within the rack. It can then
    be queried for the number of such permutations, the list
    of permutations, the highest "plain" score in the list,
    and the list of the permutations having the highest such score.
    It also generates valid combinations of the
    rack with a single additional letter.

    WordDatabase can judge whether a particular word is valid
    on the board, given a dictionary. It uses a preprocessed word
    graph (DAWG) loaded from a text file. The word graph is
    implemented in class DawgDictionary in dawgdictionary.py.

    This class loads and maintains a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG) of valid words.
    The DAWG is used to check racks for validity and to find all valid words embedded
    within a rack.

    The word database is fairly big (several megabytes) so it is important to avoid multiple
    instances of it. The Tabulator implementation below makes sure to use a singleton
    instance of the WordDatabase class, in the class variable _word_db, across all invocations.

    The word graph is loaded from a text file, 'ordalisti.text.dawg', assumed to be in
    the 'resources' folder. This file is separately pre-generated using DawgBuilder.run_skrafl()
    in dawgbuilder.py.

    The graph contains a cleaned-up version of a database originally from bin.arnastofnun.is,
    used under license conditions from "Stofnun Árna Magnússonar í íslenskum fræðum".
